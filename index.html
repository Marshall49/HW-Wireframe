				<h1>The Culture</h1>
					<a href="#"><img class="image" src="img/program.jpeg"></a>
				<p>Marshall University is home to the Thundering Herd. The city of Huntington, West Virginia has the best fan base in the country and the most special story of any university out there being that of the tragic 1970 plane crash. Playing on the football team was some of the best experiences I've had in my life becauae of the culture and energy of the city.</p>

				<h1>Pride</h1>
					<a href="#"><img class="image" src="img/aside.jpeg"></a>
				<p>Marshall prides itself on its football program, to winning Conference Championships to sending guys to the NFL to making sure that every player graduates school. The tradition is unmatched and there isnt a community/fan base out there that has more energy and enthusiasm about their football program than Marshall. Everytime the team runs out of that tunnel the opposing team knows whats getting ready to happen.</p>
